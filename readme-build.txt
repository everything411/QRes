QRes Source Code Build Manual
=============================

Copyright (c) 1997-2005 by Berend Engelbrecht. All rights reserved.

Introduction
============
The Qres core library and qres.exe are written in ANSI C, using win32 API calls. 
QRes property pages (qresprop.dll) and the QRes configuration wizard (QResCfg.exe)
are written in C++, also using Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) libraries for
Windows.

The original 1997 QRes project was set up in Microsoft Visual Studio 97 (version 
5.0). Currently project files are provided so that the binary can easily be 
compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, Visual C++.Net 2003 and Borland C++
Builder versions 5.0 and 6.0.
